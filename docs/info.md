## How it works

TODO: Once I figure out how it works, fill this out.

## How to test

Assuming the ASIC is connected to the [demo board]
and suitable interface electronics have been connected (see "External hardware"),
select the \[TODO: final name\] project to get started.

## External hardware

Assuming the ASIC is connected to the [demo board],
VGA output is obtained by connecting a [Tiny VGA Pmod] or compatible module to the OUTPUT Pmod connector,
and audio output is obtained by connecting a [Tiny Tapeout Audio Pmod] to the BIDIR Pmod connector.
